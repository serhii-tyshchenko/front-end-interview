**JSON vs XML**
| JSON | XML |
| :------------: |:---------------:|
| Text based format (Not a Language) | Markup Language |
| Free to define anything | Has some rules |
| Smaller Size | Big in size due to markups |
| JSON is similar to JavaScript | Browser need parsers to handle XML |
| Objects literals. Browser read faster. | Slow processing |
| No support on namespaces and comments | Both are supported |
