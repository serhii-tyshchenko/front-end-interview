**What is Next.js, and how does it differ from traditional React applications?**

- Next.js is a React framework for building server-rendered applications. It simplifies server-side rendering (SSR), routing, and other features compared to manually configuring a React app.

**Explain the benefits of using Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR).**

- SSR improves SEO, initial page load performance, and provides better user experiences by rendering pages on the server.

**How do you create a new Next.js project?**

- You can create a Next.js project using the command 'npx create-next-app'.

**What are the main features of Next.js?**

- Key features include server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, static file serving, API routes, and dynamic imports.

**What is the purpose of the pages directory in a Next.js project?**

- The pages directory is where you define the routes of your Next.js application. Each file inside pages represents a route.

**Explain the difference between server-rendered pages and statically generated pages in Next.js.**

- Server-rendered pages are generated on each request, while statically generated pages are pre-built at build time.

**How can you create a dynamic route in Next.js?**

- You can create dynamic routes by placing files with square brackets in the pages directory, e.g., '[slug].js'.

**What is the purpose of the \_app.js and \_document.js files in a Next.js project?**
\_app.js is used to wrap your application with additional components (e.g., layout, context providers). \_document.js is used to customize the HTML document structure.

**Explain the concept of API routes in Next.js.**

- API routes are serverless functions in Next.js used to handle backend logic and serve data. They reside in the pages/api directory.

**How can you fetch data in a Next.js component on the server side using getServerSideProps?
**

- You can export an async function called getServerSideProps from your page component. It runs on the server and provides data to the component.

**What is the purpose of getStaticProps in Next.js, and how does it improve performance?**

- getStaticProps fetches data at build time and allows Next.js to pre-render pages with that data, improving performance by serving static content.

**How do you create a 404 error page in a Next.js application?**

- You can create a 404.js file in the pages directory to serve as the custom 404 error page.

**What are the benefits of using next/image for image optimization in Next.js?**

- next/image provides automatic optimization, lazy loading, and responsive image rendering, improving website performance.

- Serverless deployment involves deploying Next.js applications to serverless platforms like Vercel or Netlify, where scaling and infrastructure management are abstracted.

**How do you implement internationalization (i18n) in a Next.js application?**

- Libraries like next-i18next can be used to implement internationalization in Next.js applications.

**What is incremental static regeneration (ISR) in Next.js, and how does it work?**

- ISR allows you to re-build and re-deploy specific pages on-demand without regenerating the entire site, improving build times and page updates.

**Explain the purpose of the getStaticPaths function in Next.js and when it is used.**

- getStaticPaths is used to define dynamic routes and their possible values for pre-rendering. It is used in conjunction with getStaticProps.

- Libraries like Redux, Mobx, or React Context can be used for state management in Next.js applications.

**Explain the purpose of the Next.js API route middleware and how to use it.**

- API route middleware is used to add common logic to API routes. You can use it to authenticate, validate requests, or modify responses.

**What are the steps involved in creating a custom error page for different HTTP status codes in Next.js?**

- You can create custom error pages by naming them with the desired HTTP status code (e.g., 404.js for a 404 error).

**How can you configure routing to support clean URLs in a Next.js application?**

- You can configure clean URLs by customizing the rewrites property in the next.config.js file.

**Explain how to implement serverless functions in a Next.js application using the `api` directory.**

- You can create serverless functions in the `pages/api` directory, and they will be automatically deployed as API routes.

**What is the purpose of the next.config.js file in a Next.js project, and how do you use it to customize the Next.js configuration?**

**How can you set up CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or emotion with Next.js?**

- You can set up CSS-in-JS libraries by installing the library, configuring it in your Next.js project, and using it to style components.

**Explain the concept of "pre-fetching" in Next.js and how it benefits performance.**

- Pre-fetching involves fetching data or assets before a user navigates to a page, improving page load times and perceived performance.

**What is the purpose of the next/link component in Next.js, and how does it enhance client-side navigation?**

- next/link is a higher-order component that wraps around anchor tags (`<a>`) to enhance client-side navigation, providing better performance and user experience.
