Next.js provides a built-in API for server-side rendering, making it easy to implement this feature in your applications.

**How can you fetch data in Next.js?**

- Next.js provides several methods for fetching data. You can use the getStaticProps function to fetch data at build time and pre-render pages. This is useful for static content that doesn't change frequently. If you need to fetch data on each request, you can use the getServerSideProps function. Additionally, Next.js supports making API requests directly from your components using the useSWR hook or the fetch function.

**What are dynamic routes in Next.js?**

- Next.js allows you to create dynamic routes by using brackets ([]) in the file name of a page. For example, if you have a file called `pages/posts/[id].js`, Next.js will match URLs like `/posts/1` or `/posts/2` and provide the `id` parameter to the page component. This enables you to create dynamic pages that can fetch data based on the route parameter.

**Explain the concept of ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) in Next.js**

- ISR is a feature in Next.js that allows you to update static pages at runtime without rebuilding the entire application. With ISR, you can define a revalidation time for each page, and Next.js will automatically regenerate the page when it’s requested after the revalidation time has passed. This allows you to have both static and dynamic content in your Next.js application.

**What are the differences between `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`?**

- The main difference between `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` is the timing of when the functions are executed.

- `getStaticProps runs` at build time and fetches data that is used to pre-render static pages. The fetched data is available as props to the page component.
- `getServerSideProps` runs on each request and fetches data dynamically. This is useful for pages that require fresh data on each request.

**How can you handle routing in Next.js?**

- Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Each file in the pages directory represents a route in your application. For example, a file called `pages/about.js` will be accessible at the `/about` URL. You can also create nested directories and files to represent nested routes. Next.js also provides the `Link` component for client-side navigation between pages.

**What is the purpose of the `Link` component in Next.js?**

- The `Link` component in Next.js is used for client-side navigation between pages. It automatically preloads the linked page in the background, improving the user experience. The `Link` component also handles the active state of the link, adding an active class to the active link. It is recommended to use the Link component instead of the anchor (`<a>`) tag for internal navigation in Next.js applications.

**How can you handle internationalization (i18n) in Next.js?**

- Next.js provides built-in support for internationalization through the next-i18next library. With this library, you can easily translate your Next.js application into multiple languages. It supports features like automatic language detection, language switching, and dynamic content translation. By using the useTranslation hook provided by next-i18next, you can access translated strings in your components.
