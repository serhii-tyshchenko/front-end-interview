**What is Angular Modules?**

- Angular modules are containers for organizing and encapsulating different parts of an application.

## Component and Template

**What is an Angular component?**

- An Angular component is a basic building block of an application and represents a part of the UI.

**How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component?**

- Data can be passed using Input properties.

**Explain Angular templates.**

- Angular templates are used to define the HTML and views for an Angular component.

**What is a structural directive in Angular?**

- Structural directives like \*ngIf and \*ngFor are used to modify the structure of the DOM.

**What is event binding in Angular?**

- Event binding allows you to listen for and respond to events in the template, such as button clicks.

## Services and Dependency Injection

**What is a service in Angular?**

- A service is a class that provides some functionality across the application.

**Explain Dependency Injection in Angular.**

- Dependency Injection is a design pattern used in Angular to provide components with the required dependencies.

**How do you create a service in Angular?**

- You can generate a service using the Angular CLI: ng generate service my-service.

**What is the purpose of the @Injectable decorator in Angular?**

- It marks a class as a service and provides metadata about its dependencies.

**How do you inject a service into a component?**

- You inject a service into a component’s constructor using dependency injection.

## **Directives and Pipes**

**What are Angular directives?**

- Directives are markers on the DOM elements that tell Angular to do something with that element.

**Explain the \*ngFor directive.**

- \*ngFor is used for iterating over a collection (e.g., an array) in the template.

**What are Angular pipes?**

- Pipes are used for transforming and formatting data in the template.

**What is FormControl and FormGroup in Angular forms?**

- FormControl represents an individual form control, while FormGroup is used to group multiple form controls.

**How do you handle form submission in Angular?**

- You can handle form submission by listening to the form’s submit event or using the (ngSubmit) directive.

## **HTTP and Observables**

**How do you make HTTP requests in Angular?**

- You use the HttpClient module to make HTTP requests.

**What is an Observable in Angular?**

- Observables are used to handle asynchronous operations, like HTTP requests.

**Explain the difference between** `subscribe()` **and async pipe when working with Observables.**

- `subscribe()` is used in the component code to manually subscribe to an Observable, while async pipe is used in the template to automatically subscribe and display the data.

**What is CORS, and how does it relate to Angular and HTTP requests?**

- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by browsers that can affect HTTP requests in Angular applications.

**How do you handle errors in HTTP requests in Angular?**

- You can handle errors using the `catchError` operator or the error callback in `subscribe()`.

## **State Management**

**What is state management in Angular, and why is it important?**

- State management is about managing the state of an application and ensuring that components have access to the data they need.

**Explain the role of NgRx in Angular state management.**

- NgRx is a state management library for Angular that implements the Redux pattern.

**What are the core principles of Redux?**

- Redux principles include a single source of truth, state is read-only, and changes are made through pure functions.

**How do you share data between components that are not directly related?**

- You can use a shared service, state management libraries, or @Input/@Output bindings.

**What are the key differences between local and global state in Angular?**

- Local state is specific to a component, while global state is accessible across the application.

## **Testing**

**What is unit testing in Angular?**

- Unit testing in Angular involves testing individual components, services, and modules in isolation.

**What tools and libraries can you use for testing in Angular?**

- Jasmine and Karma are commonly used for unit testing in Angular. You can also use tools like Protractor for end-to-end testing.

## **Random questions**

**1\. What is an Angular directive, and how is it different from a component?**

*   An Angular directive is a marker on the DOM element that tells Angular to do something with that element. Directives are used to add behavior, manipulate the DOM, or transform the element. Unlike components, directives do not have templates and are used to extend the behavior of existing DOM elements.

**Can you explain the Angular CLI and its key commands for managing an Angular project?**

*   The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool for creating and managing Angular applications. Some key CLI commands include:

```javascript
ng new <app-name>: Creates a new Angular application.
ng generate component <component-name>: Generates a new component.
ng build: Compiles the application.
ng serve: Starts a development server.
ng test and ng e2e: Run unit and end-to-end tests, respectively.
```

**How does Angular support internationalization (i18n) and localization in applications?**

*   Angular supports i18n and localization through the @angular/localize package. You can use the ng xi18n command to extract translatable messages from the application, and then use the $localize service to define translations for different languages in your templates.

**What is the purpose of Angular’s HttpClient Interceptors, and how can they be used?**

*   Angular’s HttpClient Interceptors are used to intercept and transform HTTP requests and responses. They can be used for tasks like adding headers, logging, caching, or handling errors globally. Interceptors are registered in the app’s providers and applied to all HTTP requests.

**How do you handle authentication and authorization in an Angular application?**

*   Authentication in Angular is commonly handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Authorization is often role-based, and you can control access to routes and components using route guards. Angular provides CanActivate and CanActivateChild guards to restrict access based on authentication and user roles.

**Explain the role of Angular’s NgZone and change detection in improving application performance.**

*   Angular’s NgZone is a service that helps manage change detection. Change detection can be resource-intensive, and by using NgZone, you can optimize when and how change detection is triggered. By using OnPush change detection strategy and minimizing change detection cycles, you can significantly improve application performance.

**What is the purpose of Angular’s ng-content directive, and how is it used for content projection?**

*   Angular’s ng-content directive is used for content projection. It allows you to pass content from a parent component’s template into the child component’s template, enabling dynamic and flexible component composition. It’s particularly useful when creating reusable components.

**How do you implement server-side rendering (SSR) in an Angular application, and what are its benefits?**

*   To implement SSR in Angular, you can use frameworks like Angular Universal. SSR improves initial load times, SEO, and performance by rendering pages on the server and sending pre-rendered HTML to the client. It also enhances accessibility and user experience.

**What are Angular schematics, and how can they be used for code generation and project scaffolding?**

*   Angular schematics are blueprints for generating code and project structures. They provide a way to automate common development tasks. You can use schematics to generate components, services, modules, and more. Custom schematics can be created to fit specific project requirements.

**Can you explain the Angular Zone and how it relates to change detection and performance optimization?**

*   The Angular Zone is a mechanism for managing change detection. Angular runs change detection in a zone, which allows it to track asynchronous operations. By optimizing how change detection is triggered and minimizing unnecessary change detection cycles, you can improve application performance and responsiveness.
